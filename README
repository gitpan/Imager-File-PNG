Imager::File::PNG provides PNG file format support for Imager.

It requires libpng, including development files, to be installed.

For Linux distributions this typically requires installation of the
associated -dev or -devel package.

See Imager::Install for more information.

Imager::File::PNG is currently shipped as part of Imager, but Imager
may install without installing Imager::File::PNG, so if you need PNG
support, add a dependency on Imager::File::PNG.
